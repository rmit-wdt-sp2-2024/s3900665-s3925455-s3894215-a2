# MCBA Web Application - Assignment 2

This repository contains the source code for the Most Common Bank of Australia (MCBA) web application, developed as part of the Web Development Technologies (WDT) course at RMIT University.

## Project Overview

Our team has developed a robust MVC application for the Most Common Bank of Australia. The application is built using ASP.NET Core 7.0 and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. We have implemented a code-first approach for database creation and management, allowing us to efficiently update and maintain the database schema throughout the development process.
